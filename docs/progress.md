# Progress

Update this file in every PR. Phases are defined in [review-v2.md §8](review-v2.md#8-revised-plan-and-timeline-solo-developer--agents-honest-estimate).

## Current phase: **MVP-0: local demo with mock data** (finishing) → next: **M1 production MVP**

## Done

### 2026-11-05: M0 bootstrap
- Research by four parallel agents; evaluation in `docs/analysis.md`.
- Card vault, EPay verifier, CI security gates, AGENTS.md, project review agents.

### 2026-11-05: v2 review + MVP-0 build
- **Decisions** (`docs/review-v2.md`, ADR-009…014):
  - Static Vite SPAs instead of Nuxt SSR.
  - SSE instead of Centrifugo.
  - Built-in CS Inbox instead of Chatwoot (for now).
  - Voice calls dropped.
  - ZPay Alipay v1 first.
  - One domain.
  - Pull-based deployment.
- **Backend** (agent-built, orchestrator-verified):
  - FastAPI modular monolith with all MVP-0 endpoints from `docs/api-contract.md`.
  - Alembic schema: FORCE RLS, `app_api` / `app_delivery` roles with column grants, ledger Σ=0 trigger.
  - Separate delivery service: outbox, `SKIP LOCKED` card claim, internal reveal with circuit breaker.
  - Full ZPay notify pipeline.
  - Gated mock ZPay, seed data, keygen.
- **Frontend:**
  - `web` (Vant 4, mobile-first, EN/zh-CN): home, search, product, chat with product/quote/order cards, image and voice clips, orders, reveal, me.
  - `admin` (Element Plus): dashboard, products, inventory import, orders (price change, manual delivery), CS Inbox, ledger, audit.
  - 77 KB gzip initial JS.
- **Reviews run, findings fixed:**
  - *i18n-mobile-reviewer.* 4 Medium fixed: safe asset/pay URLs, contrast, focus ring.
  - *payment-auditor.*
    - FAIL #12 (timeout budget) fixed.
    - FAIL #13 (replay guard could lose a payment on crash) fixed.
    - Re-query trade_no/out_trade_no matching added.
    - Very late payments are now recorded.
    - Mock gated to dev/test.
    - https required for the query base in prod.
  - *security-reviewer.*
    - H1 (secret sprawl) fixed: per-service env files and Redis ACL users.
    - M2 (proxy IP) fixed: fixed edge IP set as the trusted proxy.
    - M6 (edge part) fixed: Caddy headers are defaults only.
    - App-side fixes M1/M3/M4/M5/M6/L1/L5/L8/L9: see the commit log.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Pillow pinned to 13.0.0 on Python ≥3.11 (GHSA-78g4-xqwv-q3g8 and 3 CVEs).
  - Uploads restrict decoders to the sniffed format.
- **Deploy:**
  - Compose stack sized for a 2 GB host.
  - Non-superuser schema owner; internal backend network with no egress.
  - `bootstrap.sh` generates all secrets.
  - `demo-update.sh` with a systemd timer.
- **CI:** backend tests against real PG and Redis; frontend checks; Semgrep; gitleaks (scoped allowlist); images + Trivy; **full-stack E2E smoke test**; GHCR publish only after E2E passes.
- **E2E smoke (v3):** also covers site/articles/recommendations, instant account via PoW, multi-field delivery, order lookup, after-sales (replace + refund), staff card find/void/replace, `file` messages and `/me` self-service; the frontends were reconciled against the real API (see `docs/api-contract.md`).

## Next

### MVP-0 wrap-up
1. [ ] Owner click-through on the demo host, then collect UX feedback.

### M1: production MVP (6–8 weeks; exit gate = independent security review + restore drill)
1. [ ] Infra: measure SoftBank↔IIJ and CN→edge latency; WireGuard mesh; nftables; SSH over WireGuard only.
2. [ ] Real ZPay merchant account (¥88). Configure `APP_ZPAY_*` via SOPS. Reconciliation job. External alerting on `manual_review`, `payment.*` critical audits and breaker trips.
3. [ ] Staff TOTP + step-up for card import; admin served on an admin-only path (VPN or Cloudflare Access); email verification; canned replies.
4. [ ] OG share endpoint `/s/{id}` + `sitemap.xml`.
5. [ ] Private R2 bucket for uploads (proxied via the edge); separate media origin; server-side voice transcoding.
6. [ ] pgBackRest → US + R2; restic; automated monthly restore drill; key-compromise runbook.
7. [ ] Security review follow-ups:
   - L2: SSE re-auth on heartbeat.
   - L4: per-domain ask buckets + negative-cache invalidation.
   - L7: SCRAM verifiers in the migration.
   - Frontend Low items: touch targets, aria-labels, image dimensions, plural forms, `console.warn` lint.
8. [ ] Stock reservation at order creation, so the last card can't be sold twice into `manual_review`.
9. [ ] Independent pentest. **No real money before it passes.**

### Scheduled
- [ ] **2026-11-12:** raise `minimumReleaseAge` in `frontend/pnpm-workspace.yaml` to 10080 (7 days) and drop its `nosemgrep`.
- [ ] When an upstream `caddy:2.11-alpine` ships go-jose ≥ v4.1.6: remove the xcaddy stage in `deploy/web.Dockerfile`.

## Open questions for the owner
- [ ] Legal review of payments for mainland users (aggregator + later USDT).
- [ ] Which hostname of your domain to use for production. For HTTPS on the demo, point `demo.<domain>` at the demo host's IP.
- [ ] Chatwoot re-evaluation at M2: only if there are ≥3 agents, on a ≥4 GB server.

## Known issues
- Local dev Python is 3.10: Pillow there is capped at 12.3 (advisories fixed only in 13.0.0, which needs ≥3.11). CI and the images use 3.12 + Pillow 13.
- `filelock` (dev-tool transitive) advisories are advisory-only in CI.
